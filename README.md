# 📌 Portfolio

![Project preview](./public/img/preview.png)

## 📝 Overview

Portfolio deployed on `GitHub Pages`. The main idea behind this portfolio was to use the `parallax` effect. I decided to use an image from the game Firewatch and build my color palette around it. I created the different parallax layers myself.

This site is animated and responsive, but nothing beats visiting it to see for yourself.
